        Psychiatrists can help you whenever you are feeling worried, sad, and angry, which can make your everyday life hard. A psychiatrist is like a doctor, the only difference is that they focus more on mental health. They can diagnose people with many conditions like anxiety, depression, BPD, PTSD, mood swings, narcism, etc. Psychiatrists are very different from counselors and psychologists. Like doctors, they too have to go to medical school before being able to treat others. They have the same powers as doctors. They prescribe medication, order tests, and when necessary, they can send patients to the hospital. When diagnosing a patient, they consider many factors. Such as their brain chemistry being balanced. The look at how life events affect the person. Stress and family history is a common role in mental illness. Physical conditions can often affect a person's mental health. Some serious conditions they can diagnose, which are rare but possible, like schizophrenia, OCD, and more. Treatment often comes in a two-part plan. Medication and talk therapy, where you get to talk about your feelings and thoughts. It allows patients to have a better understanding of what's going on with them and it helps gain a better control over their lives. In order to keep track of their patients' progress over time, they keep detailed records of their patients. They may focus on treating children and teenagers or, they might only treat elderly patients. Doctors who specialize in forensic psychiatry work with the police and courts, they assess people who have committed crimes to see if they have a mental health issue. Psychopharmacologists study the use of certain drugs to treat mental illness.

          To become a psychiatrist, you need to go to medical school. You need a 4-year bachelor's degree to apply. You also have to take some required science courses. Getting into medical school is very competitive. Most people also get a master's degree before they apply. Good grades will help you get into medical school. But there are other factors to consider. Most schools look at your extracurricular activities. They also want you to have leadership skills and good character. You will likely need to write the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Many people have to take it more than once to get into medical school. Medical school takes 4 years to finish. You will graduate as a medical doctor (MD). To become a psychiatrist, you must then complete 4 years of residency training. Residencies are periods of practical, on-the-job training. These take place in hospitals or other medical settings. You can choose to specialize in a field such as forensic psychiatry. For that, you will need another 1 to 2 years of training. To become a board-certified psychiatrist, you must pass another exam. This is set by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN). You also need to get licensed in the state where you want to work.

          Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers. Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a "year-round, full-time" hours figure of 2,080 hours; for those occupations where there is not an hourly wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data. The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate. This wage is equal to or greater than $100.00 per hour or $208,000 per year. Estimate not released. The location quotient is the ratio of the area concentration of occupational employment to the national average concentration. A location quotient greater than one indicates the occupation has a higher share of employment than average, and a location quotient less than one indicates the occupation is less prevalent in the area than average.
